# License Manifesto

```
The GNU Manifesto (which appears below) was written by Richard Stallman in 1985 to ask for support in developing the GNU operating system. Part of the text was taken from the original announcement of 1983. Through 1987, it was updated in minor ways to account for developments; since then, it seems best to leave it unchanged.

Since that time, we have learned about certain common misunderstandings that different wording could help avoid. Footnotes added since 1993 help clarify these points.

If you want to install the GNU/Linux system, we recommend you use one of the 100% free software GNU/Linux distributions. For how to contribute, see http://www.gnu.org/help.

The GNU Project is part of the Free Software Movement, a campaign for freedom for users of software. It is a mistake to associate GNU with the term “open source”—that term was coined in 1998 by people who disagree with the Free Software Movement's ethical values. They use it to promote an amoral approach to the same field.
